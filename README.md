# Tokyo Rust Website

Source code for the Tokyo Rust community website.

## Goals

* Provide a place to share info about the Tokyo Rust community, such as
    * upcoming events
    * past events
    * how to sponsor
    * sponsors list
    * members list
    * contributors list
    * and more
* Provide an opportunity for Tokyo Rust members to participate in a real Rust project

## Project Constraints

* Favor development in Rust over other languages even if Rust may not be the best choice
    * Reason: giving community members a chance to work with Rust in a real project is a priority
* Favor search engine optimization
    * Reason: main purpose of site is to share information. People need to be able to find that information easily via search engine
    * This means server-side rendering or conventional templating is prioritiezed over client-side rendering

## TODOs

- [] Website design
- [] Choose a backend framework
- [] Choose a frontend framework (or choose no framework, i.e. conventional templating or similar)
- [] Feature List

## How To Contribute

* Fork this repo
* Make a feature branch
* Make a PR back to the main repo's main branch
